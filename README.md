# REITs vs InvITs Regulatory Classification Analysis

## Overview
Comprehensive financial analysis examining SEBI's August 2025 decision to classify REITs as equity while excluding InvITs from equity mutual fund allocation. This research project analyzes the regulatory decision from multiple economic and policy perspectives.

## Key Findings

### Payout Analysis
- **REITs**: 5-6x higher distribution yields (5.7-6.2%) vs equities (0.5-2%)
- **Mandatory Payouts**: REITs distribute 90% of NDCF (SEBI regulated) vs equities 0-25% (discretionary)
- **Conclusion**: REITs exhibit bond-like income characteristics despite equity classification

### Inflation Hedging Analysis
- **InvITs**: Superior inflation hedge (beta = 1.59)
- **REITs**: Partial hedge (beta = 0.6)
- **Methodology**: OLS regression on 45 months of asset return data (Feb 2022 - Nov 2025)

### Market Coverage Gap
- DLF (equity): 46 analysts
- Embassy REIT: 16 analysts
- Mindspace REIT: 10 analysts
- **Gap**: REITs receive 4-6x less analyst coverage, indicating information asymmetry

## REITs Analyzed
1. **Embassy Office Parks REIT** - Yield: 5.5-6.0%
2. **Mindspace Business Parks REIT** - Yield: 5.0-6.0%
3. **Brookfield India Real Estate Trust** - Yield: 7.0-7.3%
4. **Nexus Select Trust** - Yield: 5.0-5.5%

## Equity Comparables
- DLF Ltd (dividend yield: 0.58%)
- Godrej Properties (dividend yield: 0%)
- NIFTY 50 average yield: 1.5-2.0%

## Regulatory Arguments

### For Equity Classification
 Volatility profile reflects market dynamics (not purely fixed-income)
 Mutual fund structural access opens capital pool to 2-3 trillion potential investors
 Global benchmarking (US, Singapore, Australia classify REITs as equity-like)

### Against Pure Equity Classification
 Payout mandate (90% NDCF) creates income-focus vs discretionary equity payouts
 Yield profile (5.7-6.2%) fundamentally differs from equity returns (1.5-2.0%)
 Quarterly NDCF stability (-3 to +12% variance) vs high equity earnings volatility (20-50%)
 Asset-backed security with contractual leases (3-10 years) bond-like characteristics

## Conclusion
**REITs are hybrid instruments** combining bond-like cash flow predictability with equity-like appreciation optionality. While SEBI's equity classification enables mutual fund access and regulatory harmonization, the data suggests REITs occupy a distinct "Equity-Plus-Income" category fundamentally different from pure equities.

For inflation-proof Indian portfolios: **Overweight InvITs for hedging, use REITs for diversification with strict exit strategies triggered 3-4 months after inflation spikes.**

## Methodology

### Data Sources
- SEBI filings and REIT annual reports
- Screener.in, ICICI Direct, company investor relations
- Indian REITs Association data
- RBI CPI inflation data
- NSE NIFTY indices

### Analysis Techniques
- **Payout Analysis**: Historical dividend and distribution yield calculations
- **Correlation Studies**: Pearson correlation matrices across asset classes
- **OLS Regression**: Rolling 12-month periods to model asset returns vs inflation
- **Fundamental Ratios**: Cap rate spread (340 bps), FFO yield analysis
- **Analyst Coverage**: Tracking institutional research depth

## Time Period
FY 2019-20 to FY 2024-25 (5 financial years for dividend analysis)
February 2022 to November 2025 (45 months for inflation hedging analysis)
